# Energy Demand Forecasting

## Objective: A utility company wanted to predict the electricity demand accurately to optimize power generation and distribution.

## Approach: Time series data from past years, including historical demand, weather data, and holidays, was collected. SARIMA and Prophet models were used to capture seasonality and trends. DeepAR was applied for probabilistic forecasting with prediction intervals.

## Outcome: The accurate forecasts enabled the utility company to optimize power generation, reduce operational costs, and prevent energy shortages during peak demand periods.
